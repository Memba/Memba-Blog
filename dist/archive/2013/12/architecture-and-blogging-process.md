## Architecture

**Memba Mini Blog Engine** has 3 building blocks:

1. The content which you write as markdown files (with metadata);
2. A Grunt task which you execute on the command line to build an RSS index of your content;
3. A Single Page Application (SPA) embedding widgets to display indexes, content, comments and like buttons in the browser.
