## Why a new blog engine?


## Architecture and process
TODO

## Getting Started
The requirements are those of Grunt: you need to install [NodeJS] (http://nodejs.org/) and [Grunt] (http://gruntjs.com/).
Then we recommend cloning this Git project or downloading an archive. More on the [Memba Mini Blog Engine web site](http://http://miniblog.memba.com).

## Disclaimer
Before you get too excited please consider that this is 'work in progress' which has not even reached an 'alpha' stage.

## Contributing
You can help by testing and reporting defects, making suggestions or even better contributing code fixes and improvements. In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). We have provided setup.cmd and make.cmd to this effect.

## Release History
_v0.1.0_ - First commit

## Licensing
This code is bound to the GPL license considering the use of [Telerik's Kendo UI framework] (http://www.kendoui.com).
As far as Memba is concerned, this code is free to use for all types of applications.
